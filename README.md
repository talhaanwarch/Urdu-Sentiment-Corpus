# Urdu Senitment Corpus: A labeled dataset for Urdu sentiment analysis and sentiment classification

### About the dataset
The dataset contains 999 tweets in Urdu language, collected between 14 August 2014 – 17 December 2014. During the mentioned period, the political parties in Pakistan, in particular, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) were protesting in Islamabad against the government. The tweets were publicly available and randomly selected. So it was used on “as is” basis. 

Each tweet in the data set was labelled by three judges, whether it is Positive (P), Negative (N) or Objective (O)? The final label was considered positive where the tweet got two positive votes, so with the negative, otherwise, it was called objective.

### Legends
- The hash sign # coming at the start of the line means a comment.
- Each line (if not a comment) has the Urdu text enclosed in quotes, and the class / final label assigned to that tweet. i.e. P, N, or O i.e. Positive, Negative or Objective respectively. A comma (,) separates the quoted Urdu text and its class.
